        Attach the log here! Preferably as a file attachment, by dragging the file to the message box.
        **Windows:** `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\LocalLow\Klei\Oxygen Not Included\Player.log`   
        **Mac:** `~/Library/Logs/Klei/Oxygen Not Included/Player.log`  
        **Linux:** `~/.config/unity3d/Klei/Oxygen Not Included/Player.log`  

        **Can I just send the smaller log from the crash screen?**  
        No, that is a "strack trace", and the games best guess of where things went wrong; it is helpful for Klei team, rarely to modders. Please send the complete file.  

        **DO NOT** selectively send a smaller piece of the log because you think that is all that is relevant. I will consider the issue invalid.
